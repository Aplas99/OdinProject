# The Road So Far...


## Intermediate HTML and CSS 
   **What I learned:**

1. Learned about the Emmet plugin for VS Code. 
It utilizes shortcuts to generate boilerplate HTML and automatically create the start/end tags for many HTML elements. 
Some useful abbreviations are: 
    "!" generate the DOCTYPE Declaration as well as, head and body tags ->

        <!DOCTYPE html>
        <html lang="en">
        <head>
            <meta charset="UTF-8" />
            <title>Document</title>
        </head>
        <body> 
        </body>
        </html>

    Child: ">" to embed elements within each other and automatically create the start and end tags -> 

        nav>ul>li
            <nav>
                <ul>
                    <li></li>
                </ul>
            </nav> 


2. SVG, or Scalable Vector Graphics is a scalable image format, that will easily scale to any size and retain their quality without increasing their filesize. Theyâ€™re also very useful if you need to create or modify your images programmatically, because you can change their properties through CSS and JavaScript
SVGs are often used for:
- Icons
- Graphs/Charts
- Large, simple images
- Patterned backgrounds
- Applying effects to other elements via SVG filters

But why is SVG useful:
